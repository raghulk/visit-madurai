                    <p>Float Festival is one of the main festivals celebrated in Madurai. It takes place on the full moon night of the Tamil month, Thai, which falls between mid January and mid February. The concept of the festival dates back to the 17th century, when it was celebrated for the first time by King Thirumalai Nayak. He constructed an artificial tank and then, built a temple of Lord Vigneswara on the island in the middle. He started the custom of taking the idols for a boat ride in the tank.</p>
