            <h1>Grading Rubric</h1>
            <h3>Good Design</h3>
                <p>This entire website has a consistent color scheme and uses the same fonts. I took special consideration to make the website look neat and clear in desktop and mobiles. I used easy layout techniques which made it easier to make the website responsive. It also incorporates the same (or similar) design on each page for visual continuity.</p>
            <h3>Organization of Information</h3>
                <p>The content and the images are well organised in the website and makes it easier on the eye for the users to read paragraph of texts along with images. The navigation bar links are well spaced out too.</p>
            <h3>Content of the Website</h3>
                <p>There is enough amount of content to explain all the aspects of Madurai. I have one paragraph-long text for every place/topic that I have mentioned in the website. The descriptions of the images are personal insights along with some facts.</p>
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>The navigation of this site is very simple and obvious, in the desktop version there is a link to every page of the website in the header and in mobile version this can be accessed through a hamburger menu. The footer is also on every page and has links the contact, rubric and references page.</p>
            <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
                <p>HTML and CSS are laid out in a structured manner and easy to understand as I have also used white-spce to good effect and indented my code for easy-readability. They both validate. I have used Google fonts and for those whose browser is not able to load Google fonts, I have used an alternate sans-serif font.</p>
            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>JavaScript was used to validate the correctnes of the form and show the users any errors that they may have made while filling out the form. I used a Google's JavaScript map API for the homepage to show Madurai. I have used separate functions for running slideshows on all the pages that are required.</p>
            <h3>PHP</h3>
                <p>PHP is used to send the data of the form back to me on submitting the form.</p>
            <h3>Images</h3>
                <p>As I visited quite a while ago, there wasn't any specialised camera that I could take pictures of, so most of the images are taken from online and I have cited them. I have used a shadow effect and transform effect(on hovering) to enhance the image and to increase interactiveness of the website.</p>
